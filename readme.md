# About the project

In this project, I have developed a comprehensive C++ library aimed at managing recommendation systems and user data for major streaming companies. The purpose of this library is to enable these companies to offer highly accurate and personalized movie recommendations to their customers. The library includes a robust set of features designed to handle user and movie management, recommendation generation, data persistence, and more.
